# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
This repository contains projects for Deep Reinforcement Learning, Nanodegree via [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893).

## Projects Overview

__P0_TaxiReinforcement__: Learning

__P1_Navigation__: Navigation

Leverage neural networks to train an agent to navigate a virtual world and collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

__P2_Continuous__: Control Continuous Control

Train a robotic arm to reach target locations. For an extra challenge, train a four-legged virtual creature to walk.

__P3_Collaboration__: Competition Collaboration and Competition

Apply reinforcement learning methods to applications that involve multiple, interacting agents. These techniques are used in a variety of applications, such as the
coordination of autonomous vehicles.
