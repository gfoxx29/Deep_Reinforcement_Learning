# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
This repository contains projects for Deep Reinforcement Learning, Nanodegree via [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-reinforcement-learning-nanodegree--nd893). All of the projects use simulation environments from Unity [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and OpenAI [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). 

## Projects Overview

### OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v2 Task
>[P0_Taxi](https://github.com/nalbert9/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/P0_Taxi)

In this project, we use ```OpenAI Gym's Taxi-v2``` environment to design an Reinforcement Learning algorithm to teach a taxi agent to navigate a small gridworld. 

### Navigation
>[P1_Navigation](https://github.com/nalbert9/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/P1_navigation)

Leverage neural networks to train an agent to navigate a virtual world and collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

### Control Continuous Control
>[P2_Continuous](https://github.com/nalbert9/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/P2_Continuous-control)

Train a robotic arm to reach target locations. For an extra challenge, train a four-legged virtual creature to walk.

### Competition Collaboration and Competition
>[P3_Collaboration](https://github.com/nalbert9/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/P3_Collab-compet)

Apply reinforcement learning methods to applications that involve multiple, interacting agents. These techniques are used in a variety of applications, such as the
coordination of autonomous vehicles.
