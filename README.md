# Deep_Reinforcement_Learning
This repository contains projects for Deep Reinforcement Learning. All of the projects use simulation environments from Unity [ML-Agents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents) and OpenAI [Gym](https://gym.openai.com/). 

## Projects Overview

### Navigation
>[P1_Navigation](https://github.com/nalbert9/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/P1_Navigation): In the first project, we will train an agent to collect yellow bananas while avoiding blue bananas.

### Control Continuous Control
>[P2_Continuous](https://github.com/nalbert9/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/P2_Continuous-control): In the second project, we will train an robotic arm to reach target locations.

### Competition Collaboration and Competition
>[P3_Collaboration](https://github.com/nalbert9/Deep_Reinforcement_Learning/tree/master/P3_Collab-compet): In the third project, we will train a pair of agents to play tennis.
